Welcome to libPONA!
===================

libPONA is an object-oriented and portable system programming library
targeting BSD and Linux systems. libPONA is written in C++ with zero
dependencies to exiting C++ libraries and only a few references to
the underlying C library. Most classes are implemented directly on
top of POSIX or BSD system calls.

libPONA partly breaks the static typing system of C++ to support a
more elegant programming style using assisted memory management and
automatic type casting. The project's goal is to provide a maximum of
functionality on a minimum code footprint, while favoring correctness
over feature completeness.

The entire library is licensed under a triple-clause BSD license,
which is compatible to GPLv3.
