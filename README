Welcome to libPONA!
===================

libPONA is a system programming library, which provides an object-oriented
description of the POSIX API. It is written from scratch to support the
development of highly concurrent applications thriving in a networked world.
Implemented in C++, it breaks the ideological foundations of the C++ language
by autocasts and variant types.

libPONA targets to be fully self-contained, with no dependencies to other
libraries, whatsoever. All object-oriented abstractions provided are meant
to be as transparent as possible and to resemble the logic of the underlying API.

libPONA is for lazy people! If you like to track all memory allocations by hand,
you won't need this library. Provided by the Ref class all pointer to objects
are managed automatically. This resembles the basic concept of automatic garbage
collection of agile programming languages like Python or Ruby.

In libPONA automatic reference counting has much less overhead than in other programming
environments. Setting the default reference policy (in pona/defaults.hpp) to Pointer
will replace standard references by raw pointers providing maximum performance.
Yet, explicitly declared restrictions by specifying Owner or SetNull policies
are still enforced.
