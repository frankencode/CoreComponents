Welcome to libPONA!
===================

libPONA is an alternative C++ runtime and utility library.
It is based solely on BSD system calls and core C++ language features.
The goal is to create a highly consistent library, which enables writing realtime
applications with a high chance of survivability in an open networked world.
Therefore the main design objectives are rather different from the standard
STL+boost libraries. The goal is to create a passively safe API encapsulating
non-obfuscated implementations, which are easy to prove for correctness.
Passively safe means, there shouldn't be a possibility to misuse any
function in a way that stays undiscovered or is otherwise unobvious.

Current Features:
	- incremental automatic garbage collection
	- UTF8 based string processing
	- generic pattern matching and parser construction
	- rich set of static and dynamic containers
	- formatting binary and textual I/O
	- file and directory I/O
	- file streams and streaming sockets
	- IPv4/IPv6 routing information
	- advanced thread synchronisation (e.g. golang style channels)
	- thread-safe local statics, singletons and standard I/O
	- process forking, file locks and shared memory
	- overloading of signals
	- thread and process termination events
	- access to user and group information
	- precise timers
	- pseudo random numbers
