Welcome to libPONA!
===================

libPONA is a core C++ programming library on top of the POSIX standard. It tries
to map proven logic of system interfaces as complete and fail-safe as possible into
a clean object-oriented space. Short and sometimes cryptic reading system calls become
translated into more readable method names. Under its hood libPONA hides the often
daunting details of memory allocation, error handling and type casting.

Features:
    * Policy base reference class providing assisted memory management
    * Powerful string and list processing
    * Efficient syntax processing automata with infinite lookahead and rich support for both context-free and context-sensitive languages
    * Consistent I/O framework including sockets and pipes
    * Endian-neutral bit-vise I/O streams
    * Integrated support of parallel execution paradigms: signals, threading and process forking
    * Supported Platforms: OpenSolaris, Linux, Darwin, FreeBSD
