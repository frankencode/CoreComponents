Installation Intructions
========================

FTL comes with a cmake build system. To simplify common configuration task
a wrapper script is included (cmake/wizard), which takes care of most configure
choices. Run "make help" to see the details. Of course you can configure and
build the project like any cmake project by hand.

Supported Platforms:
	Generally BSD, Linux and Mac OS X are supported.
	See the release notes for details: http://github.com/unclefrank/libftl/wiki/Release-Notes

Prequisites:
	cmake 2.8 (includes ccmake)
	g++ >4.2 (on Mac OS X), g++ >3.6 (for all other)

Building and installating using the cmake/wizard:
	cd <libftl-source-dir>
	# edit make.conf
	make

Building by hand using ccmake:
	mkdir <my-build-dir>
